\begin{Abstract}
The production of single top quarks is a cornerstone in understanding the nature of the heaviest known elementary particle and its involvement in electroweak interactions. An early differential cross section measurement of t-channel single-top-quark production is presented. Collision data at a center-of-mass energy of $13~\mathrm{TeV}$ collected in 2015 were analyzed, corresponding to $2.3~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The amount of signal events as a function of the top quark transverse momentum and rapidity is estimated by multiple fits using a multivariate discriminant. The results are unfolded to parton level and compared to predictions by various Monte-Carlo generators.

\section{Introduction}

Cross section measurements of single top quark production allow to study electroweak interactions involving heavy quarks. For example, precise inclusive cross section measurements can yield model-independent limits on the CKM matrix element, $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{tb}$, whereas differential measurements can test theoretical calculations and predictions by generators in great detail.

In this note, a first differential cross section of t-channel single-top-quark production as a function of the top quark \pt and rapidity, $y=\frac{1}{2}\ln[(E+p_{z})/(E-p_{z})]$, is presented, using the first pp collision data recorded by the CMS experiment in 2015 at $\sqrt{s}=13~\mathrm{TeV}$ corresponding to $2.3~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. It is based on Ref.~\cite{TOP-16-004}.

\section{Event selection}

The measurement focuses on single top quarks decaying to a b jet, a muon, and a neutrino. The t-channel production signature consists furthermore of a light, spectator quark~(u/d/s) which is characteristically scattered into the forward detector region. Muon candidates are required to be well-isolated with a transverse momentum of $\pt>22~\mathrm{GeV}$ within a pseudorapidity range of $|\eta|<2.4$. Jets with $\pt>40~\mathrm{GeV}$ are selected within $|\eta|<4.7$. A b-tagging algorithm is employed for jets within $|\eta|<2.4$ based on a multivariate discriminant to identify b jets from top quark decays. A selection on the transverse W boson mass of $\mtw>50~\mathrm{GeV}$ is applied discriminate against multijet events. In addition to the signal region~(2~jets, 1~b-tag), events from two control regions containing 3~jets with 1~or 2~b-tags are considered. These are enriched in \ttbar events which is the main background of this measurement.


\section{Signal extraction}

A neutrino candidate is found by solving for the unknown $p_{z}^{\nu}$ momentum under a W boson mass constraint, $m_{W}^{2}=(p_{\mu}+p_{\nu})^{2}$. The 4-momentum of a top quark candidate can then be reconstructed from the reconstructed decay products.

To extract the signal yield as a function of the reconstructed top quark \pt and $|y|$, multiple, exclusive maximum likelihood fits are performed. The fits utilize an extended likelihood using the $\mtw$ shape for events with $\mtw<50~\mathrm{GeV}$ and the shape of a Boosted Decision Tree~(BDT) discriminant otherwise. The BDT is trained to discriminate signal against \ttbar and \wjets events by exploiting the following event observables: $\mtop$, $|\eta_\mathrm{light~jet}|$, $\Delta R(\mathrm{b\mbox{-}jet,~light~jet})$, $|\Delta\eta(\mathrm{b\mbox{-}jet,\mu})|$, and \mtw. The low $\mtw$ region is particularly sensitive to the multijet contribution whose shape is estimated from data using a sideband with inverted muon isolation. Figure~\ref{fig:mtwbdt} shows the $\mtw$ and BDT distributions after scaling the predictions to the inclusive fit result. A good agreement is observed.

The distributions of the top quark \pt and $|y|$ at reconstruction level normalized to the inclusive fit result are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:recotop} in a signal-enhanced phase space defined by $\mtw>50~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $\mathrm{BDT}>0.6$. The distribution of the top quark rapidity agrees well with the prediction. However, a slight

\end{figure}

To infer the corresponding parton-level differential cross sections, the exclusive fit results are passed to an unfolding procedure. Regularized unfolding based on the curvature of the unfolded spectrum as implemented in the \tunfold package~\cite{tunfold} is used. 

The measurement is affected by various sources of systematics.
