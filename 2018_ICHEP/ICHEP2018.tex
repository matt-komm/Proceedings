\abstract{
The electroweak production of single top quarks are excellent probes to test the predictions of electroweak interactions at the scale of the top quark mass and beyond. In this note, latest measurements of single top production in the three main production modes, $s$-channel, $t$-channel, and W-associated, at centre-of-mass energies of 8 and 13~TeV by the CMS collaboration are presented.
